| Entity | Input | Output
| User | The user will interact with the application through a computer or other device. The user will see the frontend of the application and send requests to the backend | The output is represented in many parts of the system, reaching almost every point in the system
| SYG Frontend web | It is the system with which the user interacts, it receives the requests sent by the user through the interface  | It processes incoming web requests and receives the data through SYG's backend API. Once it has the requested information, it displays it to the user through the interface
| SYG Backend API | It is the API in charge of all the business logic, it interacts with the frontend, database and external APIs  | It is the API in charge of all the business logic, it interacts with the frontend to return the data of the received requests and with the database and external APIs to get the data needed for your requests.
| Database (MySQL) | Queries, information requests | Storaged and consistent data responding to the system needs

=== Technical Context

Our application is divided into frontend (React with node.js), backend (restapi with maven), testing (e2e, integration and unit Test). In backend, we use a hexagonal architecture improving the security and performance of the website, with which we get an immutable domain for the rest of the components that can attach to this domain. The system is made with the idea of microservices in mind, using docker containers, for the deployment of these microservices used both in the project and in testing (e2e and integration test), for the unit tests Mock is used. On the frontend, the React framework is used along with typescript and MUI, together with its own styles in Sass.
The database is using MySQL, although with an immutable domain it could support other databases.

| Technology | Explication 
| MySQL | Database used for accessing and modifying data at the request of the relevant restapi
| Keycloak | Library for securing and authentication of the whole application
| React | Technology used for the frontend integration of our application
| TypeScript | Acompa√±a a react en la construccion del frontend, dando soprote y tipado a react
| SCSS | A much more complete branch of CSS, used in the application's design styles
| Grafana and Prometeus | They are services used for monitoring the system.
| Postman | It is used for testing the backend functionlity
| Docker |  Use to divide the application in multiple services (containers) based in the microservices idea. We have a container for each service (Frontend, Backend, Database, Keycloak, Grafana, Prometheus, e2e backend test, integration backend tests)
| Azure |  Is the platform used for the system deployment. It was chosen because of its extensive support and support for deployment through images, where you can make a record of these images, plus the school gives a certain amount of money for deployment through azure
