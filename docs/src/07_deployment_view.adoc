* Motivation:
 This diagram helps to point out the different components we will need to use and their dependencies. It helps to visualise the deployment path for the system to work.

* Quality and/or Performance Features:
In order to improve the quality of the system, the latest and most advanced technologies will be used, trying to minimise waiting times for user requests.
 
* Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure:

=== Infrastructure Level 2

* Motivation:
 This second diagram details the launching of the layers. 

* Quality and/or Performance Features:
